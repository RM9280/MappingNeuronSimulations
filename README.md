This Java package simulates the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of a neuron, allowing the study of action potentials, ion currents, and firing frequency. 
The package also includes a simple graphing utility (SwingGraphics) to visualize membrane potential and currents over time.

The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a foundational computational neuroscience model describing the ionic mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons. This package provides three variations of HH neuron simulations:

HH_NeuronStarter – Basic simulation with separate sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) currents, visualized with graphs.

HH_NeuronStarter2 – Runs multiple simulations across a range of stimulus amplitudes, identifying the threshold for action potential generation.

HH_NeuronStarter3 – Simulates action potentials and calculates firing frequency for different stimulus amplitudes.

SwingGraphics - Graphing utility for displaying 2D line plots of simulation data.

All simulations utilize Euler integration for numerical computation of membrane potentials.
